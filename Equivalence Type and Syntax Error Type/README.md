# Overview
This document describes the methods used to make SQL queries equivalent and non-equivalent. Specific techniques are employed to achieve this. 
Additionally, for advanced syntactic error analysis, particular types of errors are intentionally introduced to make the queries syntactically incorrect.
* Query Equivalence and Non-Equivalence: This section discusses different strategies for modifying SQL queries while maintaining their functional equivalence, such as changing join orders or converting between explicit and implicit joins. It also explores methods for intentionally creating non-equivalent queries by altering conditions or aggregate functions, useful for testing the robustness of SQL processors and understanding query optimization.
* Syntax Error Types: The syntax error section categorizes advanced errors that can occur in SQL queries, such as misuse of aggregation functions without a GROUP BY clause, inappropriate use of the HAVING clause, and aliasing issues. It highlights common pitfalls that could lead to runtime errors or logical mistakes in query processing, emphasizing the importance of syntax correctness in SQL query development.
