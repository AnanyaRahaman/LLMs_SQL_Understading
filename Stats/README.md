## Overview
This directory contains four CSV files that provide statistical analyses of SQL queries from different datasets used in our experiments. 
Each file documents metrics such as Query_length/char_count, word_count, Query_Type, Aggregate, Table_Count, join_count, Nestedness_Level, Column_Count, 
Function_Count, and predicate_count. These metrics help understand the structural and syntactic properties of the queries, aiding in the evaluation 
of LLM performance on SQL tasks.

* sqlshare_stats.csv: Metrics for queries from the SQLShare dataset.
