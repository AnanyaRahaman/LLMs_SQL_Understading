# Overview
This folder contains ANTLR files used for parsing SQL queries to check their syntactic correctness. ANTLR, which stands for ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a powerful tool utilized here to construct robust parsers. These parsers are essential for breaking down SQL queries into their constituent elements and checking each element against SQL grammar rules to determine their correctness. This syntactic analysis is critical as it forms the foundation for further analysis in our experiments. By ensuring that the SQL queries are free of syntactic errors, we can more accurately assess their semantic integrity and performance in subsequent testing phases. This process not only helps in identifying basic syntax errors but also in validating the structural feasibility of complex SQL commands within our research framework.
