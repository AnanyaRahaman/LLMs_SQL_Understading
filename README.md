# Overview
This repository contains a collection of tools and datasets designed to evaluate the understanding of SQL queries by large language models (LLMs). 
Our focus is on various aspects of SQL processing, including syntax error detection, missing token identification, 
query performance prediction, and query equivalence checking.
What's inside the repository:
ANTLR: Uses ANTLR files for parsing SQL queries to check their syntactic correctness.
Codes: Jupyter Notebooks with scripts for syntax error evaluation, missing token identification, and more.
Datasets: Includes datasets used for different SQL-related tasks to assess model performance.
Stats: Contains statistical analysis files detailing the properties of SQL queries.
Queries Equivalence and Syntax Error Types: Documentation on methods for assessing query Equivalence and Types of Sybtax Error.
